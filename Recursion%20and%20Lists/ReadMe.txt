Can you think of an invariant (property that is always true) of peanoplus? What is the Big O of peanoplus?
 -The function is always called y times. O(n) for y

What is the Big O of peanotimes?
 -O(xy)

The values given by (choose 4 k) correspond to the coefficient of the row n = 4 in Pascal's triangle
